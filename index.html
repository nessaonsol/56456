    <div class="section">
        <h2>Our Marketing Strategy</h2>
        <p>Here's how we'll psyop people into buying our ALTCOIN:</p>

            <div class="step">Target ads to people who engaged with altcoin season content</div>
            <div class="step">Cash out once enough people buy into the narrative</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Will Work</h2>
        <p>The psychology behind our psyop:</p>

            <li><strong>Social proof:</strong> Paid influencers and fake testimonials</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted ads:</strong> Show up right when people are looking</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Execution</h2>
        <p>When TikTok and YouTube are full of "altcoin season" content, we strike:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Launch targeted ads saying "It's altcoin season - buy ALTCOIN"</li>

            <li>Target people who watched or liked altcoin season content</li>
            <li>Make it seem like ALTCOIN is THE coin for altcoin season</li>
            <li>Ride the wave of existing altcoin season hype</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
